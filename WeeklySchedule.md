Generate 5 paragraphs of text and include the generated paragraphs as static text in your notebook. Include a short write up:
  - Explain in words how the sentence is generated.
  - Is the output what you expected?
  - How could you generate an unexpected output?
- **Add** a link to your Colab to the [Sketches Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r7vP1i6M4yef5M0_E-yHuoVpyYvxM1T05yCEytOVe4E/edit?usp=sharing) (login to your NYU Google account to access)
