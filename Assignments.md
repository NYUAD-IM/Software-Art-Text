# Assignments

## Assignment 1 - Assemblage
  - **Create** a text artwork using Python. The artwork could be the generated text, the code itself, or a combination
  - The work should:
    - Use algorithms to generate the text
    - Use elements of an existing corpus of texts (e.g. a collection of songs, poems, or scraped web pages)
    - Be presented on a web page
    - Explore how algorithms can recombine generated and existing text to create new expressions
    - Have an emotional impact on the reader, for example through the choice of text corpus and recombination technique
  - The text should be accompanied by the following documentation:
    - A link to your Colab or source code
      - See [Syllabus - Coding](https://github.com/NYUAD-IM/Software-Art-Text/blob/main/Syllabus.md#coding)
    - A writeup (on your webpage or in your Colab):
      - See [Syllabus - Writing](https://github.com/NYUAD-IM/Software-Art-Text/blob/main/Syllabus.md#writing)
      - Consider the following prompts:
        - How does your algorithm work?
        - Why did you choose this content and algorithm?
        - How does the final output differ from what a person would write?
        - What thoughts or feelings does your output provoke?
- **Submit** the links to your assignment, source code, and documentation via Brightspace
- **Prepare** to present your work in class (6-8 minutes + discussion)

## Assignment 2 Fiction
  - **Create** a short work of fiction using Python
  - The work should:
    - Be 3 or more paragraphs long, with a narrative story / arc
    - You can incorporate code that you have previously used
    - You can generate text "from scratch", remix existing content, and/or generate text using machine learning (e.g. GPT-2)
    - A new story / fiction should be generated each time the program is run (you can choose 1 or more of the generated outputs to present on the web page)
  - The text should be accompanied by the following documentation:
    - A link to your Colab or source code
      - See [Syllabus - Coding](https://github.com/NYUAD-IM/Software-Art-Text/blob/main/Syllabus.md#coding)
    - A writeup (on your webpage or in your Colab):
      - See [Syllabus - Writing](https://github.com/NYUAD-IM/Software-Art-Text/blob/main/Syllabus.md#writing)
      - Consider the following prompts:
        - How does your algorithm work? How do you generate the storyline?
        - What topics/processes are you exploring in your work? What did you hope to achieve?
          - e.g. infinitely generated possibilities, use of time, sense vs nonsense
        - How does the presentation of your work shape the response of the reader?
  - **Submit** the links to your assignment, source code, and documentation via Brightspace
  - **Prepare** to present your work in class (6-8 minutes + discussion)

## Assignment 3 - Final
  - For the Final Assignment you can choose to continue working on one of your previous projects or create a new work.
  - The work should:
    - Build on concepts and techniques that we've covered in class
    - The presented work should have a definite aesthetic. It could be for example raw code, a polished output, or a physical object, and it should have an intentional artistic presentation.
  - The text should be accompanied by the following documentation:
    - A link to your Colab or source code
      - See [Syllabus - Coding](https://github.com/NYUAD-IM/Software-Art-Text/blob/main/Syllabus.md#coding)
    - A writeup (on your webpage or in your Colab):
      - See [Syllabus - Writing](https://github.com/NYUAD-IM/Software-Art-Text/blob/main/Syllabus.md#writing)
      - Consider the following prompts:
        - How does your project continue on themes / topics you have explored in the class?
        - Why did you choose to present the work in the way you did? Do you consider the code to be the artwork? The output? Both?
        - What algorithms are you using and how did they affect your process and output?
  - **Submit** the links to your assignment, source code, and documentation via Brightspace
  - **Prepare** to present your work in class (10-12 minutes + discussion)
